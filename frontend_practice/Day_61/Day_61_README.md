# Day 61 - HTML Basics: Getting Started

## Objective
Understand the fundamentals of HTML and create my first proper web page with basic structure and elements.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – Main HTML file with basic structure

## Concepts Practiced

- HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Meta tags (`<meta charset>`, viewport settings)
- Page title and basic headings
- Paragraph and text elements
- Basic semantic markup

## What I Learned

This was my starting point. I learned that HTML isn't complicated—it's just a set of tags that tell the browser how to structure content. Understanding the proper document structure was crucial because everything else builds on this foundation.

I realized that even the simplest web page needs:
- Proper opening and closing tags
- Correct nesting of elements
- A clear hierarchy from heading to paragraphs

This day set the tone for my entire learning journey. Getting the basics right meant fewer struggles later on.
