# Day 85 & 86 — Mastering JavaScript Functions & Closures

## 🎯 What I Learned / Practiced

### Part 1: Function Foundations (Day 85)
- **🔹 Types of Functions** — Explored Function Declarations, Function Expressions, and ES6 Arrow Functions.
- **🔹 Hoisting** — Verified that declarations are hoisted while expressions are not.
- **🔹 IIFE** — Used Immediately Invoked Function Expressions for private logic isolation.

### Part 2: Advanced Logic & Closures (Day 86)
- **🔹 Rest & Default Parameters** — Learned to handle missing arguments and dynamic data inputs (`...`).
- **🔹 Closures & Lexical Scoping** — Mastered how functions remember their "lexical parent" variables even after execution.
- **🔹 Practical Closures** — Built persistent counters and secure data vaults.

## 💡 Reflection
Combining these two days really showed me how functions transform from simple code blocks into powerful, stateful machines through Closures. This is the heart of professional JavaScript.
