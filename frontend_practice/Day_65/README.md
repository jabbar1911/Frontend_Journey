# Day 65 - HTML Elements: Forms and Input

## Objective
Learn to create forms and various input elements for user interaction and data collection.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML file with form elements and inputs

## Concepts Practiced

- Form element (`<form>`)
- Input types: text, email, password, number, date, checkbox, radio, file
- Text areas and labels
- Select dropdowns and options
- Submit and reset buttons
- Form attributes and basic structure
- Accessibility with proper labeling
- Form validation attributes (`required`, `type`)

## What I Learned

Forms are how websites talk to users and collect information. I learned that HTML provides many input types built-in, each serving a specific purpose.

Important lessons:
- Labels should always be connected to inputs for accessibility
- Different input types handle different data better (email for emails, date for dates, etc.)
- Form structure matters—using proper `<form>` tags makes code cleaner
- HTML5 input types provide built-in validation in many browsers
- Submit buttons trigger form submission

This day made me realize that good form design starts with understanding what data you need and choosing the right input types for each piece of information.

While HTML can handle basic forms, I learned that real form processing would need backend code, which I haven't covered yet.
