# Day 68 - CSS Styling: Advanced Selectors and Properties

## Objective
Expand CSS knowledge with more advanced selectors and styling techniques to create more sophisticated designs.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML file with varied elements
- `style.css` – CSS with advanced selectors and properties

## Concepts Practiced

- Advanced CSS selectors (descendant, child, attribute selectors)
- Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, `:nth-child`)
- CSS specificity and the cascade
- Box model (border, outline)
- Border styles and radius (rounded corners)
- Box shadow
- Text shadows
- Hover effects and transitions (basic)
- Opacity and transparency
- CSS variables (custom properties)

## What I Learned

My CSS skills took a big step forward. I learned that you can do so much with CSS beyond just colors and fonts. Small effects like hover states and rounded corners make websites feel more polished and interactive.

Key insights:
- Pseudo-classes let you style elements based on user interaction or position
- The box model explains how spacing works in CSS
- Borders, shadows, and effects add depth to designs
- Hover effects improve user experience without needing JavaScript
- Understanding specificity prevents CSS conflicts

I also started appreciating the details—things like subtle shadows and smooth transitions are what separate amateur designs from professional ones.

This day made me realize that CSS is much more powerful than I initially thought, and mastering it opens up lots of creative possibilities.
