# Day 66 - CSS Basics: Introduction to Styling

## Objective
Take my first steps into CSS and learn how to make HTML look visually appealing with color, fonts, and basic styling.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML file
- `style.css` – External CSS stylesheet

## Concepts Practiced

- CSS syntax and selectors (element, class, ID)
- Linking external stylesheets to HTML
- Color properties (hex, rgb, named colors)
- Font properties (font-family, font-size, font-weight)
- Text styling (text-align, text-decoration, line-height)
- Basic spacing (margin, padding)
- Background colors
- CSS comments

## What I Learned

CSS was a game-changer. I realized that HTML provides structure, but CSS makes it beautiful. The power of separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) became clear.

Key insights:
- External stylesheets keep code organized and reusable
- Different selectors let you target elements in flexible ways
- Colors and fonts have huge impact on how a page looks
- Margin and padding are different and serve different purposes
- CSS is written in a specific syntax that must be followed exactly

I also learned the importance of the cascade in CSS—later rules override earlier ones, which can be tricky but also powerful.

This day was exciting because I could instantly see changes reflected on the page by tweaking CSS values.
