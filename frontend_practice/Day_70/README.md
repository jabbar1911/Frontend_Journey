# Day 70 - Image Gallery: Layout and Styling

## Objective
This project is part of my frontend learning journey and focuses on practicing CSS Grid layouts and CSS Transformations. I created an interactive grid layout, applied multiple hover-based image transformation effects, and built a responsive image gallery using modern CSS techniques.

What I built includes a CSS Grid demo with a clean 3×2 layout, Font Awesome search icon integration, six different hover-based image transformation effects, and a fully responsive image gallery created using CSS Grid.

## Concepts Practiced

- Grid and flexbox basics for gallery layout
- Responsive image sizing
- Hover effects on images
- Aspect ratio and image containers
- CSS grid or flexbox (`display: grid` or `display: flex`)
- Box sizing for consistent layouts
- Text overlays on images
- Transitions and animations (basic)
- Image borders and shadows
- Gallery navigation

## What I Learned

Building a gallery pushed me to think about layout in new ways. I realized that CSS has powerful layout tools like Flexbox and Grid that make arranging items simple.

Key insights:
- Flexbox and Grid are game-changers for layouts
- Making images responsive requires proper container sizing
- Consistent spacing and gaps create professional-looking galleries
- Hover effects draw user attention and improve interaction
- Good galleries balance visual appeal with usability

I struggled initially with responsive images—making them fit containers properly—but once I understood aspect ratios and container sizing, everything clicked.

This project showed me that modern CSS can handle complex layouts without complicated code. The days of using tables for layout are long gone!

I also learned the importance of optimized images—large image files slow down galleries, so compression is important.
