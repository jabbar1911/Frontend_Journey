- Box sizing for consistent layouts

## What I Learned

Building a gallery pushed me to think about layout in new ways. I realized that CSS has powerful layout tools like Flexbox and Grid that make arranging items simple.

Key insights:
- Flexbox and Grid are game-changers for layouts
- Making images responsive requires proper container sizing
- Consistent spacing and gaps create professional-looking galleries
- Hover effects draw user attention and improve interaction
- Good galleries balance visual appeal with usability

I struggled initially with responsive images—making them fit containers properly—but once I understood aspect ratios and container sizing, everything clicked.

This project showed me that modern CSS can handle complex layouts without complicated code. The days of using tables for layout are long gone!

I also learned the importance of optimized images—large image files slow down galleries, so compression is important.
