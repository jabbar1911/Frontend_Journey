# Day 72 - CSS Transitions & Animations

## Objective
To understand how CSS transitions and animations add motion and interactivity to web pages, making user interactions smoother and more engaging.

## Files Included
├─ index.html – Structured HTML demonstrating transitions and animations 
├─ style.css – CSS for transitions, keyframe animations, and visual effects

## Concepts Practiced

- CSS transitions and hover effect
- Transition properties, duration, timing function, and delay
- CSS animations using @keyframes
- Transform functions (translate, rotate, scale)
- Infinite animations
- Animated UI elements
- Icon animation using Font Awesome

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand that animations are not just visual effects—they improve user experience by providing clear feedback and smoother interactions.


Important lessons:
- Transitions make interactions feel natural
- Keyframes allow full control over animation flow
- Motion helps guide user attention
- Balanced animation improves usability

I also learned that using only CSS, without JavaScript, is enough to create engaging and modern animations when used thoughtfully.
