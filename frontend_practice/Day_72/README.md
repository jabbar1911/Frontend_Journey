## What I Learned

This day focused on making things look beautiful and professional. I learned that UI styling is about more than just making things pretty—it's about creating an intuitive, pleasant experience for users.

Key discoveries:
- Buttons should look clickable with proper styling and hover states
- Forms are more usable when styled thoughtfully with clear labels and input areas
- Cards are a versatile component for organizing content
- Color consistency creates a cohesive brand feel
- Attention to details like focus states improves usability and accessibility

I realized that professional websites don't just happen—they're the result of careful thinking about every element and its purpose.

This project raised my standards for what "finished" means. Before, I thought a website just needed to work. Now I understand that good design helps users accomplish their goals more easily and enjoyably.

I spent time on refinements like making buttons feel responsive to clicks and ensuring form inputs were easy to use. These small touches make a big difference in user experience.
