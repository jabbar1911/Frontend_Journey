# Day 69 - CSS Backgrounds and Images

## Objective
Master the use of background images and CSS properties to create visually rich web pages with image-based designs.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML file
- `style.css` – CSS with background image styling
- `images/` – Folder containing background images and assets

## Concepts Practiced

- Background image property (`background-image`)
- Background size, position, and repeat
- Background attachment (fixed vs scroll)
- Gradient backgrounds
- Multiple background images
- Image optimization for web
- Background color as fallback
- Parallax effects (basic)
- Overlays and blending modes

## What I Learned

Background images completely changed how I thought about web design. Instead of plain colors, I could use images to create rich, textured backgrounds that make pages visually appealing.

Important discoveries:
- Background images are different from `<img>` tags—they're CSS styling
- Image file size matters for page loading speed
- `background-size`, `background-position`, and `background-repeat` control how images display
- You can create subtle effects with gradients instead of solid colors
- Multiple layers of backgrounds create depth

I also learned that not all images work well as backgrounds—performance and readability are important considerations.

This day showed me how background images are a powerful tool for creating visually stunning websites while keeping HTML clean and simple. Professional websites use this technique extensively.
