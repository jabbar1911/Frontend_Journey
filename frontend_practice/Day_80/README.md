  ├── one.js     # External JavaScript file
  └── README.md  # Project documentation
```

## What I Learned / Practiced

- **JavaScript: The Brain of the Web** – Understanding its role as a client-side scripting language that provides the logic making pages "alive."
- **Writing JavaScript** – Practicing inline `<script>` tags and linking external `.js` files for a cleaner, modular structure.
- **Developer Tools** – Using the browser console (`console.log`) for real-time debugging and output.
- **Basic Logic** – Transitioning from static design to interactive development using basic variable declaration.

## Reflection / Key Takeaways

Today marks a new chapter in my learning journey. Knowing that JavaScript is the bridge between a static layout and a dynamic user experience is exciting. Building a strong foundation in syntax and debugging early on is essential as I move toward more complex logic.
