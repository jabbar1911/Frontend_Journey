# Day 82 - Exploring JavaScript Datatypes & Type Conversions

## Objective
To understand the different ways JavaScript stores and handles data internally, focusing on primitive and non-primitive datatypes and how the language performs type conversions.

## 🎯 What I Learned / Practiced

- **🔹 Primitive Datatypes** – Worked with Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, and BigInt; learned about the historical `typeof null` object bug.
- **🔹 Non-Primitive Datatypes** – Explored Arrays and Objects for structured data storage and key-value pair access.
- **🔹 Type Conversion** – Mastered both Implicit (coercion) and Explicit conversions (e.g., `Number()`, `String()`).
- **🔹 Type Behavior in Operations** – Discovered how `5 + "10"` leads to concatenation ("510") while `"10" - 5` leads to math (5).

## 🌱 Reflection / Key Takeaways

Today's practice gave me clarity on how JavaScript handles data internally. Strong fundamentals in datatypes make upcoming concepts like functions and DOM manipulation much easier to understand. Building this developer mindset early is key to writing robust logic.
