# Day 76 - Bootstrap Grid System & Responsive Layouts

## Objective
To understand how Bootstrap simplifies layout structure, spacing, alignment, and responsiveness using predefined classes, specifically focusing on the 12-column grid system.

## Concepts Practiced

- **Bootstrap Grid System (12-Column Layout)** – Dividing the page into rows and columns to control element behavior.
- **Responsive Breakpoints** – Creating layouts that automatically adjust across XL, LG, MD, SM, and XS screens.
- **Column Classes** – Using classes like `col-12`, `col-sm-6`, `col-md-4`, `col-lg-3`, and `col-xl-2`.
- **Bootstrap Buttons** – Exploring `btn` and `btn-primary` for consistent UI styling without custom CSS.
- **Utility Classes** – Managing spacing and alignment with `py-5`, `text-center`, and `g-3`.

## What I Learned

This session demonstrated that Bootstrap is not just about shortcuts—it's about a mobile-first philosophy that ensures consistency across devices.

Key insights:
- **Efficiency** – Predefined classes save significant time compared to writing repetitive media queries.
- **Predictable Scaling** – The 12-column logic makes it easy to calculate how elements should sit side-by-side.
- **Visual Consistency** – Bootstrap's default styling provides a professional base that requires minimal polish for clean, modern layouts.

Bootstrap has significantly lowered the barrier to building responsive websites, allowing me to focus more on layout logic than on fixing CSS alignment issues.
