# Day 89 — Mastering JavaScript Strings, Math & Date Methods

Today's learning focused on some of the most commonly used features in JavaScript: String methods, Math operations, Date handling, and OTP generation logic.

## 🎯 What I Learned / Practiced

- **JavaScript String Methods:** mastered `trim()`, `toUpperCase()`, `replace()`, and `includes()`.
- **Palindrome & Reverse:** built logic to validate symmetrical text and reverse strings.
- **JavaScript Math Methods:** utility operations like `ceil()`, `floor()`, `round()`, and `random()`.
- **JavaScript Date Object:** extracting days, months, timestamps, and formatting time.
- **OTP Generation:** created a secure 6-digit random generator for authentication.

## 💡 Simple Example

```javascript
function generateOTP() {
    return Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000);
}
// Example Result: 482910
```

## 🌱 Reflection / Key Takeaways

Today's practice helped me sharpen skills in text processing and generating secure random data. These abilities play a huge role in building dynamic, interactive, and real-time web applications.
