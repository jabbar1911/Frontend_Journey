## What I Learned

This day was about refinement—taking what I'd learned and applying it more thoughtfully. I realized that layouts aren't just about arranging elements; they're about creating a visual experience that guides users through content.

Important lessons:
- Good layouts have clear hierarchy and flow
- Whitespace is just as important as content
- Consistency in spacing creates a polished feel
- Max-width prevents text from becoming too wide and hard to read
- Proper color combinations make designs more visually appealing

I also started thinking about users on different screen sizes, though full responsive design would come later with more media query practice.

This day taught me that the difference between amateur and professional designs often comes down to attention to these details—spacing, alignment, and balance. Small refinements make huge impacts.
