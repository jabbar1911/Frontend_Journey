# Day 71 - Media Queries & Responsive Design

## Objective
To understand how media queries work and how layouts adapt across different screen sizes. The focus was on building a clean structure and refining it for better visual clarity and responsiveness.
## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML with improved structure
- `style.css` – CSS with refined layout techniques

## Concepts Practiced

- CSS layout techniques (Flexbox and Grid)
- Responsive design basics
- Container queries and sizing
- Max-width constraints for readability
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Typography hierarchy and sizing
- Color schemes and visual balance
- Media queries for different screen sizes
- Whitespace and negative space
- Section organization and flow

## What I Learned

This day was about refinement—taking what I'd learned and applying it more thoughtfully. I realized that layouts aren't just about arranging elements; they're about creating a visual experience that guides users through content.

Important lessons:
- Good layouts have clear hierarchy and flow
- Whitespace is just as important as content
- Consistency in spacing creates a polished feel
- Max-width prevents text from becoming too wide and hard to read
- Proper color combinations make designs more visually appealing

I also started thinking about users on different screen sizes, though full responsive design would come later with more media query practice.

This day taught me that the difference between amateur and professional designs often comes down to attention to these details—spacing, alignment, and balance. Small refinements make huge impacts.
