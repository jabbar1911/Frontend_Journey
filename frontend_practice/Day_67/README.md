# Day 67 - Multi-page Website with Shared CSS

## Objective
Create a website with multiple pages and apply consistent styling across all pages using a shared CSS file.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – Home page
- `about.html` – About page
- `contact.html` – Contact page (or similar)
- `style.css` – Shared stylesheet for all pages
- Navigation links between pages

## Concepts Practiced

- Multiple HTML files in one project
- Linking HTML files together with navigation
- Single shared CSS file for all pages
- Consistent styling across multiple pages
- Relative file paths and linking
- Navigation menus
- Page organization and structure
- Maintaining consistency without repeating code

## What I Learned

This project taught me how real websites are organized. You don't put everything on one giant page—you break it into logical sections and link them together.

Important lessons:
- A shared CSS file eliminates repetition and makes updates easier
- Consistent styling across pages creates a cohesive experience
- Navigation between pages is essential for usability
- File paths matter when linking—relative paths work across a folder structure
- Scaling up from one page to multiple pages requires better organization

I realized that once you have a solid CSS file, adding new pages becomes simple. You just create a new HTML file and link it to the same stylesheet.

This day showed me how developers work efficiently by reusing code and maintaining consistency—a key principle in real-world web development.
