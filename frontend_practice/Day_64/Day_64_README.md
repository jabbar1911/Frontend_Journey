# Day 64 - HTML Structure: Building Blocks Refined

## Objective
Deepen my understanding of HTML structure with semantic elements and proper document organization.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML file with semantic structure

## Concepts Practiced

- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Container elements (`<div>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
- Navigation structure
- Footer and header patterns
- Grouping related content
- Document outline and accessibility

## What I Learned

I realized that HTML structure isn't just about tags—it's about telling a story with your code. Using semantic elements like `<header>` and `<footer>` instead of plain `<div>` tags helps both browsers and people understand the page layout.

Key insights:
- Semantic elements improve readability of code
- Proper heading hierarchy helps with SEO and accessibility
- Each section should have a clear purpose
- Good structure makes styling with CSS much easier

I started seeing HTML as creating a blueprint for both content and design. A well-structured HTML page is easier to style, easier to understand, and more accessible to everyone.
