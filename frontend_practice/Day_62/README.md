# Day 62 - HTML Elements: Building Blocks

## Objective
Explore different HTML elements and understand how to use them to structure various types of content.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML file with various elements and demonstrations

## Concepts Practiced

- Heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraph and text formatting (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Links (`<a>` tags with href)
- Images (`<img>` tags with alt text)
- Divs and basic grouping
- Semantic HTML where applicable

## What I Learned

I discovered that HTML has a tag for almost everything, and choosing the right tag matters. It's not just about making things look a certain way—it's about using semantic elements that give meaning to the content.

Key takeaways:
- Different elements serve different purposes
- Proper use of lists makes content organized
- Images need descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Links are how web pages connect to each other

This day expanded my toolkit beyond just `<p>` and `<h1>` tags and helped me appreciate the structure of well-built websites.
