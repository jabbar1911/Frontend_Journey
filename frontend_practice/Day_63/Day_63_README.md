# Day 63 - Media in HTML: Audio and Video

## Objective
Learn to embed audio and video content directly in web pages using HTML5 media elements.

## Files Included
- `index.html` – HTML file with audio and video elements
- Audio and video asset files (as applicable)

## Concepts Practiced

- HTML5 `<audio>` tag and attributes
- HTML5 `<video>` tag and attributes
- Media controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)
- Multiple source formats for browser compatibility
- Video dimensions and aspect ratios
- Fallback content for unsupported browsers
- Media attributes: `controls`, `autoplay`, `muted`, `loop`

## What I Learned

Embedding media was simpler than I expected. HTML5 made it easy to add audio and video without needing external plugins. I learned that:

- The `<audio>` and `<video>` tags are straightforward—just point them to your media file
- Different browsers support different formats, so providing multiple sources is smart
- The `controls` attribute gives users play/pause buttons automatically
- Media attributes like `autoplay` and `loop` change user experience

I also realized that media files can be large, so file size and formats matter for performance.

This day opened my eyes to how modern websites deliver rich multimedia experiences with simple HTML.
